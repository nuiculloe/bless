## Step 1: Download and Install Mkvtoolnix
 
The first thing you need to do is to download and install Mkvtoolnix on your computer. You can get it from its official website: https://mkvtoolnix.download/. There are versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Just choose the one that suits your operating system and follow the instructions to install it.
 
## Step 2: Launch Mkvtoolnix and Add 1080p Videos
 
After installing Mkvtoolnix, launch it and you will see its main interface. To add your 1080p videos, you can either click on the "Add source files" button or drag and drop them into the window. You can add multiple files at once and convert them in batch mode.
 
## Step 3: Adjust Video Settings
 
Once you have added your files, you can adjust some video settings to customize the output. For example, you can change the output format from MKV to MP4 or other formats by clicking on the "Output file format" dropdown menu. You can also change the output file name and location by clicking on the "Browse" button next to the "Destination file" box.
 
To convert 1080p videos to 720p, you need to change the video resolution. To do that, click on the "Video track" tab and then click on the "Properties" button. A new window will pop up where you can see various video parameters. Find the "Display width" and "Display height" boxes and enter 1280 and 720 respectively. This will set the output resolution to 720p.
 
You can also adjust other video settings such as bitrate, frame rate, aspect ratio, etc. according to your needs. However, be aware that changing these settings may affect the video quality and size. Generally speaking, lower bitrate and frame rate will result in smaller file size but lower quality, while higher bitrate and frame rate will result in larger file size but higher quality. You may need to experiment with different settings to find the optimal balance for your videos.
