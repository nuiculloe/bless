Fortunately, there is a tool that can help you do that easily and quickly: Remove Logo Now 2.0 by SoftOrbits[^2^]. This is a video correction tool that can remove logos, subtitles, watermarks, date and time stamps from video files. It supports various formats such as AVI, MP4, WMV, MOV, FLV, and more. It also has a batch mode that allows you to process multiple videos at once.
 
However, Remove Logo Now 2.0 is not a free software. You need to purchase a license key to activate it and enjoy its full features. If you don't want to spend money on it, you may be tempted to look for a keygen online. A keygen is a program that can generate serial numbers or activation codes for software products[^3^]. However, using a keygen is illegal and risky. You may end up downloading malware or viruses that can harm your computer or compromise your privacy.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen for Remove Logo Now 2.0 or any other software. Instead, you should buy a legitimate license key from the official website of SoftOrbits or look for alternative solutions that are free and safe. For example, you can use online tools or apps that can remove watermarks from video without downloading anything.
 
In conclusion, Remove Logo Now 2.0 is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can remove watermarks from video files. However, it is not free and using a keygen to crack it is illegal and dangerous. You should either buy a license key from the official website or use other free and safe methods to remove watermarks from video.
