PPG Wave 2.V is a virtual reincarnation of the legendary PPG Wave 2.2 synthesizer from the early 80s, which was used by artists like Depeche Mode, Tangerine Dream, and Jean Michel Jarre. It features a unique wavetable synthesis engine that can create rich and complex sounds with a distinctive digital character. You can choose from over 100 wavetables, modulate them with envelopes, LFOs, and step sequencers, and process them with filters, effects, and a bitcrusher.
 
Attack is a percussion synthesizer that combines a powerful virtual-analog synth engine with a flexible drum sequencer. It can create everything from realistic acoustic drums to electronic club beats, with full control over the sound parameters and the rhythm patterns. You can use one of the 24 drum kits or create your own from scratch, using the six sound modules that emulate kick, snare, hi-hat, percussion, tom, and clap sounds.
